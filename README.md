# Shell-Scripts
A few bash scripts that make my life easier in my Linux environments. Many of these are trivial, but I use them often enough 
that they make a big difference. I also made them for the experience of learning bash and for my own entertainment.

Current scripts:
1. back: Same functionality as `cd ..`, but you can choose how many directories to go up by (e.g. back 2 = cd ../..)
2. cv: Combines cd and mv into one command
3. fs: Fixes a strange issue with my mouse's scrolling being inverted whenever I plug it in. Executes a series of xinput 
   commands to return scrolling to its proper settings.
4. mountseas: Mount the remote school Linux server to my machine
5. sshseas: SSH into the remote school Linux server with a much shorter command
6. resize: Resize my terminal window to 80x43 without having to use my mouse
