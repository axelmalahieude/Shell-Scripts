# Shell-Scripts
A few bash scripts that make my life easier in my Linux environments. Many of these are trivial, but I use them often enough 
that they make a big difference. I also made them for the experience of learning bash and for my own entertainment.

Current scripts:
1. `back`: Same functionality as `cd ..`, but you can choose how many directories to go up by
2. `cv`: Combines cd and mv into one command. Currently a work in progress.
3. `fs`: Fixes a strange issue with my mouse's scrolling being inverted whenever I plug it in using `xinput` (fs = fix scrolling)
6. `resize`: Resize terminal window
7. `rmspace`: Removes all spaces from all filenames in a directory. This was more of a one-time issue I had, but you never know when it'll happen again. `-r` enables recursive visitation of subdirectories.
